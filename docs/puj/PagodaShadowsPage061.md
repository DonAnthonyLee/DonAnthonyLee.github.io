<!-- THE KITCHEN-GOD. -->
<h4><i>SI-MĔNG TSÀU-SÎN</i></h4>

<!-- THE gods are legion. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- These are the great images in the large temples and the odd fragments of idols in shrines; -->
<!-- the local deities, of which every village, field, and mountain has its own; -->
<!-- the invisible controllers of the thunder, the rain, the harvest, and the elements; -->
<!--  the spirits of all the dead, and especially of one's ancestors; -->
<!-- and besides these every strange object, and the site of every inexplicable phenomenon is worshipped. -->
<!-- Oddly shaped stones, queerly gnarled roots, fantastic bits of wood, waifs brought on the tide, are all gods. -->
<!-- A fisherman found a mass of half-decayed oyster-shells, the shape of which was thought to resemble a lion, and for generations that was worshipped in his house. -->
<!-- On the bank of a stream where some bamboos were cut down, the hollow stumps were filled with water, by capillary action through its fibrous roots. -->
<!-- This was considered wonderful, and travellers along the road stopped to burn incense and prostrate themselves before the mysterious deity residing among these bamboos. -->

<!-- All the chief gods have their birthdays on which they are specially worshipped, as well as at the great festivals, and at the new and the full of each moon. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;

<!-- Many of the greater gods have representatives in the family, and ashes from the incense-pots in the temples are frequently brought and worshipped in the houses. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- But, whatever else may be absent from a pagan household, Su Meng Kong is not. He is the god of the kitchen, and none would dare to set up housekeeping without him. He has been a god for hundreds of years, and all know the legend concerning him. -->
