<!-- In China, one who cannot walk is subject to perpetual extortion. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- There, as in other countries, independence secures service on reasonable terms. -->
<!-- The roads being always narrow and rough, walking is often the pleasantest and sometimes the only way of reaching one's destination. -->
<!-- Pedestrian tours are interesting, taking one along the foot of ranges of hills whose slopes are flecked with plantations of dark green firs and pale green pine-apples. -->
<!-- The fir-trees are burned into charcoal, and the gleam of the pits may be seen from afar on dark nights. -->
<!-- The pine-apple leaves yield a fibre which is woven into coarse cloth, used for summer garments. -->
<!-- Paths only a foot wide divide the patches of rice and sugar-cane, and border the plots of hemp, pulse, indigo, millet, and wheat. -->
<!-- The arable land is worth from eighty to a hundred and twenty pounds an acre, and is cultivated with extreme economy. -->
<!-- Shallow streams must be waded, or the traveller may be carried across pick-a-back by a goodnatured and strong companion. -->
<!-- Neither natives nor foreigners can safely rely on friendly offices of any sort among strangers, but from acquaintances the utmost courtesy may be expected. -->
<!-- The poorest offer hot boiled sweet potatoes, begging the wayfarer to stay his stomach with their scanty fair, while those of larger means prepare a feast and urge a prolonged stay. -->
<!-- In every case, the hostess immediately proceeds to make tea, and no protestations can persuade her to forego this customary sign of welcome. -->
<!-- She is apt to light the fire in a chimneyless earthen stove in a corner of the room, filling the whole apartment with smoke. -->
<!-- When the tea is made, it is offered with confectionery, peanut-candy, or parched rice cohering in a mixture of sugar and lard. -->
<!-- If the guest was expected, she is sure to offer also hot soup, consisting of sweet syrup, in which pellets of dough or whole eggs are floating. -->
<!-- When the traveller goes on his way, some members of the household accompany him on the road. -->
<!-- He begs them not to go a mile, and they go with him twain, and can hardly be induced to turn back. -->

<!-- On the way from Toa Pho, I saw a woman going along the street wailing aloud. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- She was hobbling slowly on her bound feet, supported by a long staff, and was telling her wrongs in a piercing wail. -->
<!-- A native preacher who was with me, although unacquainted with the person or the place, at once informed me that the woman was a widow, who had had her husband's property taken from her by his brothers. -->
<!-- She was, after the manner of women thus wronged, appealing to, the public for redress. -->
<!-- That portion of the public seen by me paid no attention to her, but went silently on with its previous occupations. -->
<!-- It is not the habit of Chinese people to put forth any chivalrous effort in behalf of the unfortunate. -->

<!-- Passing through a street in Kui Su, we were followed by a beggar whose clothes scarcely covered his begrimed body. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- But he did not rely solely on his wretched looks in getting money from people. -->
<!-- He stretched one hand for alms, and extended the other filled with writhing snakes. -->
<!-- Timid people soon paid him for going away. -->
<!-- It seems that sympathy is not a fund whereon beggars may largely draw, and so they make themselves so horrible that shopkeepers and householders will quickly give something to be rid of them. -->
<!-- One is frequently seen with his tongue protruded as far as possible, and a knife apparently stuck vertically through it. -->
<!-- Besmeared with blood from head to foot, he is sufficiently disgusting to make even those who know the knife to be a sham, willing to hasten him out of sight at any cost. -->
<!-- Sometimes beggars bring heavy stones with them, and lying down upon the doorstep, drop these stones from the arm's length upon their own chests, wailing until the master of the house gives them the cash they seek. -->
