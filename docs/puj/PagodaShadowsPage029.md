<!-- When the feet are completely remodelled, there is a notch in the middle of the sole deep enough to conceal a pennypiece put in edge-wise across the foot. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- The four small toes are so twisted that their ends may be seen on the inside of the foot; -->
<!-- and the broken and distorted bones of the middle of the foot are pressed into a mass where the instep should be. -->
<!-- The shape is like a hen's head, the big toe representing the bill. -->
<!-- There is little beside skin and bone below the knee. -->
<!-- The foot cannot be stood on without its bandages, and can never be restored to its natural shape. -->
<!-- It is a frightful and fetid thing. -->
<!-- No bound-footed woman ever willingly lets her bare feet be seen, even by those who are maimed like herself. -->
<!-- She wears little cotton shoes when in bed, putting as it were her night-cap on her feet. -->

<!-- The sepulchre for these mummied feet is very gorgeous. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- The bandages and alum-powder are always worn; -->
<!-- but the bandages are shortened one-half their length, and fine black ones are often put on over the white ones. -->
<!-- Embroidered satin shoes, with brightly painted heels, are worn, and a neat pantalet covers all but the toe. -->
<!-- What is visible appears to be the petal of a field-lily. -->

<!-- Even outside barbarians often admire this fairy foot. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- Yet the poet cannot say of the owner, -->
<!-- POET QUOTE: "Her foot so light, her step so true, Scarce from the harebell brushed the dew." -->

<!-- Her dainty feet toddle and clump, and her gait is exactly that of one walking on the points of the the heels. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- Though the Chinese poet compares her motion to that of the swaying willow, one never sees among Chinese women one who walks gracefully. -->
<!-- Those who have natural feet imitate the vacillating hobble of the bound-footed, verifying the Italian proverb, "If you always live with those who are lame, you will yourself learn to limp." -->
