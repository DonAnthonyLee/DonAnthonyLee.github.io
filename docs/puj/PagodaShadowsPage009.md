<!-- ONCE upon a time, in the province of Kwang Tung, the department of Tie-Chiu, the district Kit-ie, and the village E Lim, lived a boy named A Si, which means Number Four. -->

<!-- There were several boys of the same name in the village, and they were so called because they were fourth sons. -->

<!-- The girls interspersed among them in the families counted for nothing. -->
Yi--nâng chí-muē tŏ hiá ke-lăi bô-sǹg pâi-hâng. 
<!-- If you asked any of the people how many children they had, they only mentioned in reply the number of their sons, and said nothing about their daughters. -->

<!-- This village, E Lim, had about two thousand inhabitants, and lay near the foot of a range of mountains, from which the level rice-fields stretched away, dotted thickly with villages. -->

<!-- All the people in it were of the same surname, and probably descended from one ancestor; -->
<!-- though that ancestor lived so long ago that the people did not know whether they themselves were fifth or fiftieth cousins to each other. -->
<!-- All the people in this village were named Heng; -->
<!-- and one would need to be very familiar with the place in order to find any one he went to search for in it. -->

<!-- No matter where any inhabitant went to earn money, he always left his wife and children at home, with the ancestors who were dearer to him than his wife and children; -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- and however far he might travel or however long he might be gone, he never lost the intention of coming back to this village before he died, and bringing
with him all the money he might have. To him, home was home though ever so homely. -->
