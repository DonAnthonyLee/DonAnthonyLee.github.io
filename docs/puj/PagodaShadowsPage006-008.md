<!-- One source of great unhappiness to Chinese women is in the law which forbids the breaking of betrothal contracts, even though these be made in the infancy of the parties involved. -->

<!-- At one of the chapels somewhat remote from Swatow, a beautiful girl nineteen years old fled from her home to me and begged me to adopt her as my daughter. -->

<!-- She said she would serve me as a slave if I would but steal her and carry her away concealed in my boat. -->

<!-- She had been betrothed in childhood to a boy who had since developed a loathsome and incurable disease; -->

<!-- and though she had not seen him, she knew how horrible he was, and would die rather than marry him. -->

<!-- Her parents were not willing to carry out the contract they had made many years previously, but the boy's parents would not release them from the bargain. -->

<!-- Her mother urged her to kill herself, as the only solution of the question. -->

<!-- I sent agents to negotiate with the boy's parents, but could make no terms with them; -->

<!-- and I also sought the officials and learned that they would not condone the withholding of a bride from even such a bridegroom. -->

<!-- There was no legal way in which this child could be saved from her fate. -->

<!-- Some weeks later she was taken to the house of her husband's parents, and soon after I heard of her death. -->

<!-- Whether she died of grief or by suicide, I do not know. -->

<!-- Suicided is not uncommon among brides, nor among older women. -->

<!-- Some years ago seven young women, at a village near Swatow, entered into a compact to drown themselves together. -->

<!-- Three of them had been lately married, and after spending the customary four months at the houses of their fathers-in-law, had come to visit their own mothers. -->

<!-- They had been playmates, and were neighbours, and so they spun and sewed together, and rejoiced in their reunion. -->

<!-- Mutual confidences revealed mutual griefs. -->

<!-- One was married to an opium-smoker, a yellow bundle of bones, vibrating between besotted sleep and sottish waking. -->

<!-- One was wedded to a gambler, who spent his days and nights wasting the family substance. -->

<!-- One had a mother-in-law so stern and cruel that life was torment to those under her authority. -->

<!-- All three of the brides were miserable, and as they mingled their lamentations, their four unmarried friends and companions said to each other, "This is such sorrow as we must feel by-and-by. How better to be dead!" -->

<!-- All agreed in this, and entered secretly into a covenant to end their lives together. -->


<br>

<!-- They calculated the time when custom would again bring the married ones to their mothers' houses, and fixed the full moon of the seventh month, as the night for their escape from life. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;

<!-- When the time arrived, six of them dressed themselves in festal garments, with flowers in their hair, went hand in hand in the moonlight to the shore, bound themselves together with a rope, and threw themselves into the sea. -->

<!-- The seventh, only thirteen years old, was discovered through some noise she made in searching for her best clothing in the night, and was prevented by her mother from leaving the house. -->

<!-- From her the fate of the other six was afterwards ascertained, and their bodies were recovered and buried in one grave. -->

<!-- These are cases of extreme though not uncommon unhappiness, under the Chinese marriage-system. -->
