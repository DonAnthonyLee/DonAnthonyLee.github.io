<!-- for this couple had no children of their own, and they must have some one to rear up as theirs, to make offerings for their welfare in the spirit-world after their death. -->

<!-- He wore shoes with wooden soles an inch thick, and nankeen stockings, with his trousers tucked in at the top, and fastened there by bright blue silk garters. -->

<!-- He also began to go to school. -->
<!-- In reading, he began at what you would call the back of the book, and read down the columns of letters, beginning at the upper right-hand corner of the page, and ending at the lower left-hand corner. -->
<!-- His teacher first read a few columns to him, and Kai Bun repeated these after him. -->
<!-- Then he went to his seat and studied aloud at the top of his voice, as all the other boys did, until he had learned the lesson. -->
<!-- Then he went and turned his back toward his teacher and repeated his lesson from memory. -->
<!-- In this way he went over the whole book. -->
<!-- When he was older, the meaning would be explained to him. -->
<!-- He learned also to write, beginning by putting his copy under thin paper, and following it with a little brush wet with ink. -->
<!-- After he had learned to hold his brush and guide his hand well, he wrote the copy from memory. -->
<!-- Reading and writing would be his only studies, no matter how many years he remained at school. -->
