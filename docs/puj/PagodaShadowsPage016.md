<!-- A Si, in his new home, was no longer Number Four. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;A-sì, tŏ i sin &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi ke-lăi, bô-tsài pâi-hâng tŏiⁿ-sì. 
<!-- His name was changed to Kai Bun, which means "an aspirant in literature"; -->
<!-- and his estate was so much improved, that it was only at times that he remembered his former home with regret. -->
<!-- He here had one elder brother, who was also an adopted child; -->
<!-- for this couple had no children of their own, and they must have some one to rear up as theirs, to make offerings for their welfare in the spirit-world after their death. -->
<!-- Before this, Four had eaten boiled sweet-potatoes three times a day; -->
<!-- but now he had rice, with fish, vegetables, pork, and poultry. -->
<!-- He wore shoes with wooden soles an inch thick, and nankeen stockings, with his trousers tucked in at the top, and fastened there by bright blue silk garters. -->
<!-- His jacket was now long and fine, and he wore a black satin cap. -->
<!-- He also began to go to school. -->
<!-- In reading, he began at what you would call the back of the book, and read down the columns of letters, beginning at the upper right-hand corner of the page, and ending at the lower left-hand corner. -->
<!-- His teacher first read a few columns to him, and Kai Bun repeated these after him. -->
<!-- Then he went to his seat and studied aloud at the top of his voice, as all the other boys did, until he had learned the lesson. -->
<!-- Then he went and turned his back toward his teacher and repeated his lesson from memory. -->
<!-- In this way he went over the whole book. -->
<!-- When he was older, the meaning would be explained to him. -->
<!-- He learned also to write, beginning by putting his copy under thin paper, and following it with a little brush wet with ink. -->
<!-- After he had learned to hold his brush and guide his hand well, he wrote the copy from memory. -->
<!-- Reading and writing would be his only studies, no matter how many years he remained at school. -->
