<!-- In the centre of the village was an ancestral hall, toward the building of which all had contributed. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- It had carved and gilded flowers, crabs and tigers ornamenting the bare beams of the roof inside, porcelain flowers and birds on the ridgepole outside, and stone lions at the door. -->
<!-- On one side were shelves full of little wooden tablets, with the names of ancestors thereon. -->
<!-- At festivals, of which there are sixty-four in the Chinese year, people came and burned pieces of gilt paper, called spirit- money, and worshipped the tablets of their dead grandfathers and grandmothers. -->

<!-- On the outskirts of the village was a temple, as handsomely built as the ancestral hall, and containing, for the convenience of those who preferred one god to another, the images of several gods. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- To this temple came those who were going on a journey, those who had some business project in mind, those who wanted some especial thing, and those who feared some calamity, to worship and to make offerings of meats, cakes, and fruit to whichever god they thought had greatest influence on their particular case. -->
<!-- They put the food on dishe in rows before the god, lighted incense-sticks to burn before him, and then got down on their hands and knees, and knocked their foreheads on the floor, explaining meanwhile their desires. -->
<!-- Then they took away the meats offered to idols and ate them in their own houses. -->
