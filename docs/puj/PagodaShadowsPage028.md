<!-- It not infrequently happens that the flesh becomes putrescent during the process of binding, and portions slough off from the sole. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- Sometimes a toe or more drop off. -->
<!-- In this case the feet are much smaller than they could else be made, and elegance is secured at the cost of months of suffering. -->
<!-- The pain ordinarily continues about a year, then gradually diminishes, till at the end of two years the feet are practically dead and painless. -->

<!-- During this time the victim of fashion sleeps only on her back, lying across the bed, with her feet dangling over the side, so that the edge of the bedstead presses on the nerves behind the knees in such a way as to dull the pain somewhat. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- There she swings her feet and moans, and even in the coldest weather she cannot wrap herself in a coverlet, because every return of warmth to her limbs increases the aching.
<!-- The sensation is said to be like that of having the joints punctured with needles. -->

<!-- While the feet are being formed they are useless, and their owner moves about the room to which she is confined, by putting her knees on two stools, so that her feet will not touch the floor, and throwing her weight upon one knee at a time, while she moves the stools alternately forward with her hands. -->
