<!-- The Hakka women do not bind their feet j they lead a vigorous physical life, working chiefly in the open air. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- The better custom of these people influences those living on their borders, and the country women in their vicinity do not bind their feet. -->
<!-- On their side of Tie Chiu, among those who live in hamlets and small villages, the custom is slowly dying out. -->
<!-- In one cluster of hamlets where twenty years ago every girl's feet were bound, no one now binds a daughter's feet. -->
<!-- This laxity is unfortunately confined to the country villages in the neighbourhood of the Hakkas. -->
<!-- In the cities and large towns, all women, except slaves and bond-servants, have deformed feet. -->

<!-- Foot-binding is not so much a matter of class as of locality. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- Near the coast, even in the farmsteads and among the most indigent, every woman has bound feet. -->
<!-- It is not a voucher for respectability, for the vilest are often bound-footed. -->
<!-- Neither is it a sign of wealth, for in those places where the custom prevails, the poorest follow it. -->
<!-- Inferior wives, unless they come as bond-maids into the household, are usually bound-footed women. -->
<!-- Taking all China together, probably nine-tenths of the women have bound feet. -->

<!-- The evils that accrue from this custom are very great. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- It makes cripples of nearly half the population, and adds immensely to the misery of the poverty-stricken multitudes. -->
<!-- It disables women from supporting themselves and from caring for their children, and is one of the causes of the great prevalence of infanticide. -->
<!-- It renders women too weak to keep their houses clean, and makes their homes filthy and cheerless. -->
<!-- It incapacitates woman for travelling, and keeps her and her thoughts in the narrowest of spheres. -->
<!-- Why any should follow so pernicious a practice is one of the mysteries of human perversity. -->
<!-- There is no law that women shall bind their feet, and the women of the imperial palace at Peking are all natural-footed. -->
<!-- The origin of the custom is unknown lost in the mists of antiquity. -->

<!-- The only reason that I have heard in favour of it, aside from the common one that women would be laughed at and despised if their feet were like men's, was given me by a man, who said that it was necessary that women's feet should be bound, else they would be as strong as their husbands, and then they could not be kept in subjection by beating. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;

<!-- But the men generally offer no greater opposition to a departure from the established fashion than do the women themselves. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- For a Chinese woman the greatest of sorrows is that of having no sons; -->
<!-- the next to the greatest is that of being unlike her neighbours. -->
<!-- The smallest feet are made by those who determine to be elegant at any cost, and these draw their own foot-ligatures tighter than any one else would draw them. -->
<!-- Religion is not the only sentiment which has its martyrs. -->
