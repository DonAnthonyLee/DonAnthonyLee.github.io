<!-- CHAPTER IV. -->
# TŎIᴺ 4 CHIOᴺ

<!-- FOOT-BINDING. -->
<h4><i>PHUÂN-KIOK-KIÁU<a href="#note_1" class="note">1</a></i></h4>
<!-- 注：phuân-kiok-kiáu 特指女人缠脚，而 phuân-kha-kiáu 特指旧时行军之人用布条缠束小腿处裤管，两者不可混用 -->

<!--THE process of binding, the style of shoe worn, and the social condition of the victim, vary considerably in different parts of the empire. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tŏ Tong-kok, tsṳ-niôⁿ-nâng hiá kha tī-seⁿ tîⁿ-huap, hiá ôi tī-seⁿ chhēng-huap, hiá nâng sin-hūn tsăi-seⁿ, tī-hng m̆-sio-tâng hiá chhêng-hêng iā tuā m̆-sio-tâng.
<!-- The rich bind the feet of their daughters at six or eight years; the poor, at thirteen or fourteen. -->

<!-- They are seldom bound later than at fifteen; -->

<!-- though a case is known in which poor parents, who had sold their daughter as a slave, became rich, reclaimed her, and bound her feet when she was twenty years old. -->

<!-- The appliances for binding include no iron nor wooden shoe. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tîⁿ-kha &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi mue̍h-kiăⁿ bô-ēng thih-ôi, iā bô-ēng tshâ-kia̍h,
<!-- Only long strips of firm, flexible cloth are used. -->
tuaⁿ-sûn ēng tn̂g-tn̂g zūn-zūn iŭ tsài-năi-la̍t kâi pòu-tiâu.
<!-- We are often asked to admire the moulding power of soft influences; -->
<!-- perhaps we too seldom consider that they are as powerful for evil as for good. -->
<!-- I once saw a sturdy tree inwreathed and clasped to death by a fragile vine. -->

<!-- The bandages used in mis-shaping the feet are woven in small hand-looms, and are about two inches wide and ten feet long. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- One end of the bandage is laid on the inside of the instep; -->
<!-- thence it is carried over the four small toes, drawing them down upon the sole; -->
<!-- then it passes under the foot, over the instep, and around the heel, drawing the heel and toe nearer together, making a bulge on the instep, and a deep niche in the sole underneath; -->
<!-- thence it follows its former course until the bandage is all applied, and the
last end is sewn down firmly on the underlying cloth. -->
<!-- Once a month or oftener, the feet, with the bandages upon them, are put into a bucket of hot water and soaked. -->
<!-- Then the bandages are removed, the dead skin is rubbed off, the foot is kneaded more fully into the desired shape, pulverized alum is laid on, and clean bandages quickly applied. -->
<!-- If the bandages are long left off, the blood would again circulate in the feet, and
the rebinding would be very painful. -->
<!-- The pain is least when the feet are so firmly and so constantly bound as to be benumbed by the pressure of the bandages. -->
