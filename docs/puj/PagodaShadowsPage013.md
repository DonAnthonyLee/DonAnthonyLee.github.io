<!-- Number Four wore a bamboo hat, made in basketwork, lined with leaves, and as large as a parasol. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- The remainder of his costume was a short cotton jacket and very loose short cotton trousers. -->
<!-- His skin was yellow, and his eyes and hair jet black. -->

<!-- When Number Four grew older he had another employment, that of leading the buffalo which his father owned, and which helped to work the land. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- This buffalo was larger than a common ox; -->
<!-- its skin was like a pig's, and covered with coarse, sparse, mouse-coloured hair; -->
<!-- and its horns were long, sharp, and curved. It dragged the plough and harrow over the rice-fields, and when at rest as well as when at work must have an attendant to lead it from place to place to feed, and to see that it did not destroy the grain; -->
<!-- for there were no fences between the fields. -->
<!-- It was governed by a rope tied to a ring through its nostril. Number Four liked to ride home from the rice-field on its back, and then watch it while it rested and wallowed in a pool of muddy water. -->
<!-- When there was not enough rain, Four had also to help to turn the chain pump, which raised water from the creek to the level of the rice-fields, to water the growing crop. -->
<!-- This pump was turned by the feet, three persons stepping together on the flanges of a wheel, which turned the endless chain that brought up the water. -->
