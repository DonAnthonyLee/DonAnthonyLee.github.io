<!-- In one thing the Chinese woman is exceptionally blessed. She has inherited from former generations a style of dress at once modest, economical, healthful, and
becoming. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tong-kok tsṳ-niôⁿ ŭ che̍k-iōⁿ kuè ŭ hok-khì; i--nâng ŭ tâng soiⁿ-tō(soiⁿ-tiang-sî) thuân--lo̍h-lâi kâi che̍k-thàu saⁿ-khòu khuán, chhēng--khí-lâi kiau-kiah iŭ ha̍h-ma̍k.

<!-- It covers the whole person, and unlike many Western costumes, which make more noticeable what they profess to conceal, it shields the contour of the body from observation. -->
Chí-khuán saⁿ-khòu, thong-sin tsn̂g-kâi pau --tŏ-kò, chia-tsa̍h liáu sin-hêng bŏi pun --nâng khàn-sṳ̀ --tshut-lâi, bŏi kah hiá tsōi-kâi sai-tsuang sio-siăng, siŏⁿ-àiⁿ siu--khí-lâi --kâi tin-tò zú-kèng hiáⁿ-ma̍k.

<!--It takes but eight yards of yard-wide cloth for a complete suit of winter garments; and there is no waste in cutting nor in unnecessary appendages. -->
Tsò che̍k-sin chhìn-thiⁿ-sî saⁿ-khòu kâi pòu, khuah-sì chiâⁿ-bí liáu ŭ chhit-poih-bí tn̂g tsŭ kàu-ēng; saⁿ-khòu tsò-tît liân pòu-thâu-pòu-bué to bô.

<!-- Its truest economy, however, is in that saving of mental worry which comes from always cutting by the same pattern, and in obviating all need of fitting. -->
Yi chin-chiàⁿ séⁿ --kâi --sĭ, hiá pòu-hêng tī-seⁿ ka-huap tsn̂g-kâi pâi-pí pīn, mín-ēng siŏⁿ-sim-kek-sṳ̄ khṳ̀ huân-ló tio̍h sio-chiŭ.

<!-- It allows unrestricted play to very muscle, is of the same thickness over the whole body, is not in the way when at work, and it has little weight while it has all needful warmth. -->
Kàu-sin saⁿ-khòu kău-po̍h kò-kò sio-tâng, chhēng--khí-lâi tī-seⁿ tín-tăng to-hó, tsoh-khang-khuè --lâi bŏi tîⁿ-kha-pa̍k-chhiú, ŭ-kàu sio --lâi iā bŏi tàⁿ thīm-thīm.

<!-- Children are sometimes betrothed in infancy, but as betrothal is as binding as marriage, the Chinese have learned wisdom, and usually defer it until a year or two before the marriage, which takes place when the girl is about fifteen. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nou-kiáⁿ lân-sî sòi-sòi tsŭ tiāⁿ-chhin-chiâⁿ, put-kuè in-ūi tiāⁿ-chhin-chiâⁿ tsŭ-tio̍h uân-hun, Tong-kok-nâng tsōi-kâi ŏi sek-ma̍k tán kàu tsṳ-niôⁿ-kiáⁿ tsa̍p-ngŏu huè chìn-thò àiⁿ kè-nâng, chí tsôiⁿ --che̍k-nŏⁿ-nîⁿ chiàⁿ khio̍h-tiāⁿ.

<br>

<!-- The proposals of betrothal are made by the parents of the young man, through a matrimonial agent or go-between, whose business it is to know the history and expectations of the marriageable people of the neighbour-hood. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;Chiá hău-seⁿ-nâng kâi hun-in sĭ iû i--nâng pĕ-bó tsú-ì, liáu chhiah hiá tsuan-mn̂g thàm-thiaⁿ sì-hioⁿ-la̍k-lí tshoh lâm_hun_nńg_kè hâng-chhêng kâi buê-nâng khṳ̀ phue̍h chhin-chiâⁿ.

<!-- Sometimes the selection of the bride is left wholly to the go-between, and sometimes she simply carries messages between the parents who have formed their plans previously. -->
Ŭ-tiang-sî sin-niôⁿ kâi hun-phuè tsn̂g-kâi iû buê-nâng tsú-ì, ŭ-tiang-sî buê-nâng li-sĭ tŏ hiá phah-phue̍h hó-sì kâi sang-huang-pĕ-bó kan lâi-huê thuân-uē tiaⁿ.

<!-- The betrothal is often made without either of the persons concerned being aware of what is being done on their behalf, and the bride is brought to her husband's home without ever having seen him or any member of his family. -->
Hun-ioh tsōi-kâi sĭ sin-nâng lóng m̆-tsai tsŭ tiāⁿ--lo̍h-lâi --kâi, thăi sin-niôⁿ-kiáⁿ tshuā kàu sin-nn̂g hṳ́ tshù --kò, sĭm-chì liân sin-nn̂g kah i--kâi chhin-nâng to m̆-pat kìⁿ--kuè.

<!-- Having arrived there, she is at once incorporated in her father-in-law's household, thenceforth has little association with her own kin. -->

<!-- Her happiness depends more on the character of her mother-in-law than on that of her husband, for by her husband's mother and grandmother she is wholly ruled. -->

<!-- She is domestic servant for the whole household, and especial waiting-maid to her mother-in-law. -->

<!-- Sometimes very strong attachments are formed between these women. -->

<!-- I have seen a woman weep at being separated for a time from her mother-in-law, and express no pleasure when told that her husband was coming to see her. -->

<!-- On the other hand, there is often tyranny on the part of the elder woman, and dislike on that of the younger one. -->
