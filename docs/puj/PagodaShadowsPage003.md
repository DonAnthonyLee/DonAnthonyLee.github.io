<!-- In one thing the Chinese woman is exceptionally blessed. She has inherited from former generations a style of dress at once modest, economical, healthful, and
becoming. -->

<!-- It covers the whole person, and unlike many Western costumes, which make more noticeable what they profess to conceal, it shields the contour of the body from observation. It takes but eight yards of yardwide cloth for a complete suit of winter garments; and there is no waste in cutting nor in unnecessary appendages. Its truest economy, however, is in that saving of mental worry which comes from always cutting by the same pattern, and in obviating all need of fitting. It allows unrestricted play to very muscle, is of the same thickness over the whole body, is not in the way when at work, and it has little weight while it has all needful warmth. -->

<!-- Children are sometimes betrothed in infancy, but as betrothal is as binding as marriage, the Chinese have learned wisdom, and usually defer it until a year or two before the marriage, which takes place when the girl is about fifteen. -->

<!-- The proposals of betrothal are made by the parents of the young man, through a matrimonial agent or go-between, whose business it is to know the history and expectations of the marriageable people of the neighbour- hood. Sometimes the selection of the bride is left wholly to the go-between, and sometimes she simply carries messages between the parents who have formed their plans previously. The betrothal is often made without either of the persons concerned being aware of what is being done on their behalf, and the bride is brought to her husband's home without ever having seen him or any member of his family. Having arrived there, she is at once incorporated in her father-in-law's household, thenceforth has little association with her own kin. Her happiness depends more on the character of her mother-in-law than on that of her husband, for by her husband's mother and grandmother she is wholly ruled. She is domestic servant for the whole household, and especial waiting-maid to her mother-in-law. Sometimes very strong attachments are formed between these women. I have seen a woman weep at being separated for a time from her mother-in-law, and express no pleasure when told that her husband was coming to see her. On the other hand, there is often tyranny on the part of the elder woman, and dislike on that of the younger one. -->
