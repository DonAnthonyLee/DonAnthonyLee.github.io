<!-- Some of the children screamed and hid when they saw her; but a great many more followed her to the house where she sat down, and gazed at her with wide-open eyes, while she talked and answered questions. -->
<!-- She had blue eyes and brown hair, and looked very strange to them. -->
<!-- Some of them asked her if she was born with blue eyes, or whether her eyes had faded out; -->
<!-- some asked her if she could see at all; -->
<!-- and others asked if with such eyes she could see through a wall. -->
<!-- Some asked if all the people in the country she came from had red hair; -->
<!-- and some, if she painted her hands, as well as her face, to make them white. -->
<!-- Some wanted to know if there were rice and potatoes and trees in her country; -->
<!-- and some inquired whether her country was farther off than the one where all the inhabitan were women, and if it were really true that there were countries and people at the bottom of the sea. -->
<!-- Another, who had heard of Great Britain, remarked that in Western lands they had women for their rulers. -->
<!-- She had some books with her, and as Kai Bun could read, she lent him one, promising to make him a present of another when he should have read the first all through. -->
