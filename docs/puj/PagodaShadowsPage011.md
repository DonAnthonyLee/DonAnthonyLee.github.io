<!-- At the beginning of the play, the chief idol of the temple was carried in a decorated chair, followed by a long procession of actors and others dressed in uniform, round the village and to some of the neighbouring villages, and was then brought back to be the chief spectator at the succeeding performances. -->

<!-- Back on the mountain were the graves of all who had been buried from this village for hundreds of years. -->
<!-- The graves were dug horizontally into the hill, and before each was horseshoe-shaped masonry, three or four feet high in the centre, and sloping down to the ground the ends. Seen from a distance, the burying-ground looked like a great city. -->
<!-- Those of the Heng family who had died far outnumbered those who remained alive. -->
<!-- During the second month of the Chinese year, all who had ancestors buried here came and fastened gilded paper to flutter over the grave, and worshipped
before it. -->
<!-- If any grave lacked for three years these offerings of paper, showing that it had not been visited by the descendants of the person buried in it, the land on which it was made could no longer be claimed as private property. -->
