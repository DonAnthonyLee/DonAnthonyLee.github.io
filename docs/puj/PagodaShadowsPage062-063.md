<!-- A poor man married, and soon became rich, but he discarded the wife that had brought him good luck, and as she wandered along the road, she came to a solitary hut, in which an old man sat. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- She told this old man her sad story, and he asked her to be his wife. -->
<!-- She lived with him in the hut, and he prospered and grew rich, and built a large, fine house. -->
<!-- When the kitchen-range was partially made, a man came begging to the door, and
she discovered in him her former husband. -->
<!-- While she was giving him some money, her present husband approached, and the former husband hid in the kitchen-range and was never seen more. -->
<!-- He turned into a god and is one to this day. -->
<!-- In some families he has no image set up, and the incense-sticks burned in worshipping him are stuck in the crevices of the range chimney. -->
<!-- Many put his image in the main room of the house. -->
<!-- His birthday is the fourteenth of the seventh month, and on that day every family worships him, each in its own house. -->
<!-- On the twenty-fourth day of the last month of the year, when the gods are supposed to go off for a ten days' holiday, a paper horse and other travelling equipments are burned for his use during his journey to make his annual report to the superior gods. -->
<!-- A lamp is kept constantly burning during the first days of the new year, to indicate that the family are waiting to welcome him whenever he returns. -->
<!-- Children who have been away from home, on their return, after greeting their parents, worship Su Meng Kong. -->
<!-- If the house-mother rears fat pigs, she credits her success to his good will, and makes suitable thank-offerings to him when the pigs are sold. -->

<!-- When the father of a family dies, and the ancestral property is divided among the sons, the eldest gets the image of Su Meng Kong, the second gets the censer that stands before him, and the others get portions of the ashes from the censer. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- Each then supplies what is lack- ing in his own religious outfit, and sets up his god, and worships it before cooking a meal in his own house. -->
