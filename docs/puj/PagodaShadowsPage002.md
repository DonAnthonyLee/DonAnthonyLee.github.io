<!-- In a country where extortion is the chief use of office, and fear of it the main spur to obedience, neither women nor men claim political rights. -->

<!-- But there is no law pre- venting women from following any occupation in which they may be skilled. -->

<!-- The attainments of women in literature are much lauded and respected. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;Tsṳ-niôⁿ-nâng ŭ tshâi-chhêng, nâng-nâng lóng o-ló kah kèng-tŏng.

<!-- Practically, such attainments are uncommon; but historians refer with pride to the scholarship of a few, and novelists are fond of representing their heroines as skilled in writing both poetry and prose. -->

<!-- Knowing writers about China tell us eloquently and truly of its system for the examination and promotion of scholars, and lead one to infer that education is nearly universal. -->

<!-- In almost every village there is a private school in which a few boys are taught to read; but the proportion of those taught is very small, and native girls' schools are almost unknown. -->

<!-- Of the men, not more than one in a hundred can read; and of women, I have seen few outside the Christian mission-schools who could read, except those despised little girls who act in theatres. In the whole empire, probably not more than one woman in a thousand knows how to read. -->

<!-- For acts of heroism or for exalted virtue a woman may, like men, have an honorary portal erected for her with the emperor's sanction. -->

<!-- She may even aspire to deification, since many of the richest and most popular temples are those of the Queen of Heaven, the Protector of Sailors, and of other goddesses who were once earthly women. -->
