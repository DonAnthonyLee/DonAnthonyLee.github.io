<!-- So greatly does the welfare of the wife depend on her having sons, that it is not strange that they are her greatest desire, and her chief pride. -->

<!-- For domestic service, care in sickness, help in old age, and offerings for the sustenance of her spirit after death, she must rely on her son's wife, while her own daughter performs these services for someone else. -->

<!-- A widow usually remains in her father-in-law's house, sharing the food and labour of the family, being as much a part of the household as before her husband's death. -->

<!-- If childless, she may adopt sons, who may inherit her husband's property as surely as would his own offspring; but should she marry afterward, the estate reverts to her husband's brothers. -->

<!-- She is apt to remain in widowhood if there be ricefields affording her a living, unless she be driven to marry by the persecutions of her brothers-in-law. -->

<!-- A sad case occurred in 1875 in Kit-ie. -->

<!-- The widow was twenty-seven years old, and had a son aged ten. -->

<!-- Her husband had been dead six years. -->

<!-- His parents had both died before him, and their property had been divided lawfully and equally among their five sons, so that each owned a bit of land and a room in the ancestral home. -->

<!-- This widow continued to live in her husband's house, supporting herself and her child by the cultivation of the land, taking care of the household gear, and looking forward to her son's manhood. -->

<!-- But her husband's brothers wanted the property and the boy, and tried to persuade her to enter a Buddhist nunnery. -->

<!-- She refused, and was continually persecuted. -->

<!-- There is no law for Chinese women so plain as the law that they shall obey their elders; and, wearied out by her troubles, she at last visited some Buddhist retreats with a view to becoming a recluse; but she was so disgusted by what she saw, that she resolved more firmly than ever not to leave her home. -->

<!-- Just then she heard that in a neighbouring village, a new and good doctrine was taught, and the next Sunday she went some miles to hear a Christian sermon. -->

<!-- On her return her brothers-in-law reviled her, saying that she had been away seeking a husband. -->

<!-- The next day they sold her for a sum amounting to nearly twenty pounds, to an old man in another village, whose wife had lately died; and as she refused to go to his house, they hired a ruffian, for twelve shillings, to tie a rope around her and drag her there. -->

<!-- Her boy, who had never before been separated from her by day nor night, clung to her screaming, but was torn away and kept in the family of his uncles. -->

注：<br>
1. sĭm-mih-kâi, 何物。现大多省作 mih-kâi，部分地方读 sím-mih-kâi 等，后续篇章将采用 mih-kâi；<br>
2. me, 语气转折，暗含后续因由必定导致前述事物发生之意；<br>
3. tsáu₊-kiáⁿ, 女儿。即 tsa-bóu-kiáⁿ，此词在《卓威廉词典》（所记录时间约为 1850-1880 年） 中已产生合音，或许与 tsa-bóu 在府城之类地区被贬义化有关；<br>
