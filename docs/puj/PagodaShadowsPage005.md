<!-- If childless, she may adopt sons, who may inherit her husband's property as surely as would his own offspring; but should she marry afterward, the estate reverts to her husband's brothers. -->

<!-- There is no law for Chinese women so plain as the law that they shall obey their elders; and, wearied out by her troubles, she at last visited some Buddhist retreats with a view to becoming a recluse; but she was so disgusted by what she saw, that she resolved more firmly than ever not to leave her home. -->

<!-- The next day they sold her for a sum amounting to nearly twenty pounds, to an old man in another village, whose wife had lately died; and as she refused to go to his house, they hired a ruffian, for twelve shillings, to tie a rope around her and drag her there. -->

注：<br>
1. sĭm-mih-kâi, 何物。现大多省略为 mih-kâi，部分地方读 sím-mih-kâi 等，后续篇章将采用 mih-kâi；<br>
2. me, 语气转折，暗含后续因由必定导致前述事物发生之意；个别场合读 mo；<br>
3. tsáu₊-kiáⁿ, 女儿。即 tsa-bóu-kiáⁿ，此词在《卓威廉词典》（所记录时间约为 1850-1880 年） 中已产生合音，或许与 tsa-bóu 在府城之类地区被贬义化有关；<br>
4. sĭ-kài, 是（强调）；亦可用 kài-sĭ，亦可单用 kài。曾有学者认为 kài 可能为语流中无论何种组合均读本调者（即 kâi）反推而成，但若结合泉音类似词汇来看似乎可能性较低，备注以资参考；<br>
5. kiau, 带；和。部分地方读 khiau，后续篇章将沿用 kiau；<br>
6. nā, 在，用同 tŏ。此处采用作者所著词典音调；我处读音为 ná，即原来读 nă 的可能性较高，类似者，tŏ 在我处常读为 tó/ló；但后续篇章仍沿用 nā；<br>
7. suan, 长辈严厉责骂晚辈；此说法仅于部分地区存在，但因其他说法稍显粗俗，于作者身份不符，因而此处勉强以 mē 代替之。<br>
