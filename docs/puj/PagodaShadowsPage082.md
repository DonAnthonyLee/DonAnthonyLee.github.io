<!-- The cost of boat and men is about four shillings a day, while the cost of travel by sedan-chair is about threepence per mile. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- A chair is not always to be obtained. -->
<!-- A boat can usually be secured by a man, though a woman may sometimes fail to get a passage. -->
<!-- Returning homeward from a station upon the Swatow Bay, I one night found a head wind and surging waves opposing me. -->
<!-- After beating against these until dark, my boatmen declared it impossible to make any progress, and said that we must run in beside the shore, and wait until the wind should veer and the tide turn. -->
<!-- I had to decide whether I would toss all night where I was, or call a smaller boat, with strong oarsmen, to take me the remaining three miles. -->
<!-- I decided to have a fishing-boat called as soon as one was sighted; and, after some waiting, a little tub came along, manned by three stalwart rowers. -->
<!-- A prolonged bargaining was terminated by their agreeing to take one passenger to my landing-place for thirteenpence halfpenny. -->
<!-- They came alongside, and I stepped out from my cabin, when suddenly the little tub paddled off with might and main; the rowers exclaiming simultaneously to each other, -->
<!-- "It is a foreign lady! It is a teacherss! It is a woman!" -->
<!-- No bribe would induce them to return. -->
<!-- Their grave response to all ridicule of their sudden fright and flight was, that if they were to carry even so much of womankind as a female infant a span long, their boat wrould catch no fish for many days thereafter. -->
<!-- Happily, we were near shore; and with my long-known and trusty steersman as "guide, philosopher, and friend," I sped on foot over the hills to my home. -->
