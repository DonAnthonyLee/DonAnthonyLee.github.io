<!-- In walking, the small-footed lean on a child's shoulder or use a supporting staff. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- Those who can afford it, have large-footed female slaves who carry them about on their backs, for short distances. -->
<!-- I have been to visit a wealthy family and had the neighbouring ladies come in to see me, each riding pick-a-back on her slave. -->
<!-- A lady, whose beautiful house I went to see, was as gracious a hostess as could be found in any land; -->
<!-- but her feet were so tiny that the longest walk she could take was from one room to the next, and she was obliged to sit down after walking a few steps on her marble floors. -->
<!-- I have seen those whose feet were but two inches long upon the sole, and their shoes were no larger than those of a young infant. -->
<!-- Only the very rich can afford to be so helpless as such feet render their possessor, and there are not many who are very rich. -->

<!-- Middle-class women, with bound feet, sometimes walk four or five miles in a day. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- Many whose feet are apparently bound have natural shaped feet, merely dressed in the style of the bound-footed. -->
<!-- In some villages, the girls have their feet slightly bound just before marriage, and unbind them soon after the wedding festivities are past. -->
<!-- In some hamlets the women are all large-footed, and wade streams and walk long distances bare-footed; -->
<!-- but on approaching a town, and on gala days, they do up their feet, more or less successfully, in the aristocratic style. -->
