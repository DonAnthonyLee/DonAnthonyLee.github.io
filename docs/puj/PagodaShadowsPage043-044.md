<!-- HABITATIONS. -->
<h4><i>TSHÙ-THE̍H</i></h4>

<!-- THOUGH the masses of the people are farmers, they live in villages, not in isolated houses; and the villages are so numerous all over the land that many others may be seen from any one of them. -->

<!-- Generation after generation of the same family live in the same house and till the same fields, which descend surely from father to son. -->

<!-- Most people dwell in hovels, sleeping and eating, with their pigs and chickens, in a single room. Cholera prevails all summer, small-pox all winter, and vermin all through the year. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- They are densely crowded into their quarters, and few individuals have a separate room. -->
<!-- I have only one Chinese acquaintance, who occupies alone a brown-stone front. -->
<!-- A great brown rock has in some past age toppled over upon another rock in such a way
as to form the roof and side of a sort of lean-to, and in the crevice underneath a bachelor makes his abode, and stores the tools he usesv and the paddy he raises on the fields near by. -->
<!-- He has built up with stones and mortar the two wide openings in the ends of his apartment, and he avoids the necessity for having a chimney by doing his cooking out of doors. -->
<!-- The glinting of his fire often adds picturesqueness to the rugged hill-side of which he is the sole inhabitant. -->
<!-- By far the greatest portion of the population live in huts, which are rendered hovels by the accumulations of filth in and around them. -->
<!-- The walls are of some sort of cheap and rough mason-work. -->
<!-- The roof is of tiles, upheld by beams and slats of pine. -->
<!-- The only opening in the room is one door, and when this is closed, the light is admitted through two or three flakes of translucent shell or glass set in the roof. -->
<!-- The floors are of earth, pounded hard and level. -->
<!-- The furniture of these dwellings consists usually of poine beads and trestles, a deal table, earthen furnaces and pots, and piles of indescribable rubbish. -->
<!-- As hardly any one lives, or would be willing to live, in an isolated house, these huts
are built, with no interstices between them, along streets a yard wide, or round paved courts where clothes are dried, pigs reared, and food cured in the sun. -->
<!-- A somewhat better dwelling-house is built with its door in a high wall on the street; behind this front door is a small court open to the sky, and containing perhaps a well, a few flowering shrubs in pots, and possibly some vines clambering up a trellis. -->
<!-- On either side the court are rooms opening upon it, and at its inmost end is a large room used in common by all the inmates, and having on its wall, opposite the street-door, a grand shelf for the family gods. -->
<!-- This common room is often the receptacle of the garnered produce of the land, and of the farming implements, and of the looms, dye-pots, and washtubs of the women of the household. -->
<!-- Opening out of it on either side are two bedrooms, usually occupied by the older members of the family. -->
<!-- When sons grow old, and wives are brought home for them, the rooms area apportioned so that each son shall have one; and several married brothers and their children often live with the parents, and perhaps with grandparents and uncles, in one house. -->
