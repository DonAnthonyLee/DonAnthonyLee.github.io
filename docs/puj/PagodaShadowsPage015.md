<!-- When Four was ten years old, his father died. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;A-sì tsa̍p-huè tuā hṳ́-ē-mue̍h, i-a-pĕ kuè-sin &#x002D;&#x002D;khṳ̀.
<!-- On the seventh day thereafter, the sons bought paper clothing, trunks, and paper money, images of all the articles which he was supposed to require in the spirit-world, and burned them for his benefit. -->
Tsò thâu-chhit hṳ́-jît, tshoh kiáⁿ-tĭ bói-liáu kôu-ui, ui-sioⁿ, chîⁿ-tsuá, kah in lău-pĕ tŏ thiⁿ-téng tio̍h ēng&#x002D;&#x002D;tio̍h hiá mue̍h-kiăⁿ &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi uē-siòⁿ, liáu, lia̍h tshoh-kâi sio pun in-lău-pĕ.
<!-- Not long after, an uncle also died, and they took the opportunity to send their father an additional quantity of clothing, burning it with their uncle's outfit. -->
Keh bô jio̍h-kú, i-a-peh iā kuè-sin &#x002D;&#x002D;khṳ̀, liáu, in sêng-hṳ́-sì lia̍h àiⁿ tsài sio pun in-lău-pĕ &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi kôu-ui kah in-a-peh &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi tsò-che̍k-ē sio.
<!-- As Four's mother was still young, they did not keep the father's coffin in the house till she died and could be buried with him, but carried it at once to the hills. -->
A-sì &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi âi huáⁿ₊ hău-seⁿ &#x002D;&#x002D;tŏ, liáu mó-tit pàng in-lău-pĕ &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi kuaⁿ-tshâ nā tshù-lăi thăi in-âi kuè-sin ău tsò-che̍k-ē kám, tio̍h chiat-khek kng chiŏⁿ-suaⁿ.
<!-- A long procession followed it, the mourners being dressed in sack-cloth, with white threads braided in their hair. -->

<!-- A hired band of musicians, blowing horns, preceded the coffin; -->
Kòu &#x002D;&#x002D;lâi-kâi che̍k-khûn pûn ti-tâⁿ &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi, kiâⁿ tŏ kuaⁿ-tshâ thâu-mīn-tsôiⁿ;
<!-- and beans, peas, and grain were thrown into the grave, before the coffin was lowered. -->

<!-- The place for the grave, and the day for the funeral, had been previously selected by a wizard, who was supposed to be able to discover what was lucky in such matters. -->
Phûn-ūi kah tī-jît chiŏⁿ-suaⁿ, lóng-sĭ tsá-tsá tshuē hiá ŏi-hiáu tī-sî kit-jît kah tī-kò huang-tsúi siăng-hó kâi sin-seⁿ thóiⁿ-liáu to̍h &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi.

<!-- Shortly after this, a great man, from whom the father had borrowed money, came and demanded immediate payment. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;Sng-sṳ̄ chiàⁿ lí-tît, chioh-chîⁿ pun in-lău-pĕ &#x002D;&#x002D;kâi tuā-tshâi-tsú lâi kiò in tio̍h chiat-khek hôiⁿ-chîⁿ.
<!-- The family were in great distress, not having the means to pay the debt without selling the land on which their support depended. -->
<!-- After much trouble, and many threats from the creditor, the mother decided to accept the offer of a rich relative to whom she had applied for help, and for a sum amounting to nearly twenty pounds let him have Number Four for his own son. -->
<!-- Four and his mother and brothers all cried over it; -->
<!-- but on what was found to be a fortunate day by casting lots in the temple, he went away, to be his mother's child no more. -->
<!-- Papers of legal sale were made out, and his mother and brothers bound themselves never to make any claims of relationship upon him. -->
<!-- Even if they became rich, they could never offer to buy him back again. -->
<!-- His elder sister had been married long before, and the betrothal money spent. -->
<!-- His younger sister was then betrothed for two pounds, and went at once to be brought up by the mother of her future husband. -->
<!-- So the money due to the hard creditor was made up, and the mother had three boys left to supporther in old age. -->
