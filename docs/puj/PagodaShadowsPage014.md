<!-- With all these occupations he had no time to go to school, though there were private schools in the village, where he might have had instruction by paying a tuition- fee of eight or ten shillings a year. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- His education was that which most effectively moulds the mind; -->
<!-- it lay in the opinions and the practices of those around him. -->
<!-- He was never taught not to lie, but he was certainly punished if he stole, and so he learned to respect the rights of property. -->
<!-- He constantly heard maxims from the ancient sages, and proverbs in which the wisdom of generations was concentrated. -->
<!-- He was taught worldly caution by, "Don't lace your boot in a melon-field, nor adjust your hat under a plum-tree"; -->
<!-- reticence in speech by, "Diseases enter by the mouth, misfortunes issue from it." and " A coach-and-four cannot bring back a word once uttered"; -->
<!-- modesty of behaviour by, "Who lifts his feet high has put on boots for the first time"; -->
<!-- contentment by, "All ten fingers can't be of the same length"; -->
<!-- mutual dependence by, "There is no peace for the mouth when one tooth is aching"; -->
<!-- and for morality, he had the silver rule of Confucius, "Do nothing to others which you would not have others do unto you." -->
<!-- In the densely crowded quarters where he lived, in his varied and numerous social relationships, and in the distinct duties enforced upon him, he learned self-control, patience, and diligence to an extent seldom attained by boys of other lands. -->

<!-- Besides attending the theatre, and going through the religious ceremonies, Four did not often play, except in November when he flew a kite. -->
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<!-- The kites used were a paper star, fish, or bird, brilliantly painted; -->
<!-- and the boys would send them up to fight with each other aloft. -->
<!-- Some of them had a little wheel attached, and this, when turned by the wind, hummed as it went. -->
<!-- Sometimes the boys fastened the strings of their kites, and left them humming all night, high in the air. -->
