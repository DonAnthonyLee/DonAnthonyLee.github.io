<!-- When he was one month old he had his head shaven in spots, and when he was four months old it was shaven clean. -->
<!-- As it was cold weather, and there was never a fire in the house, he was kept warm by a little jacket thickly quilted with cotton, and by two old jackets of his father's wrapped around his legs. -->
<!-- Long before he had teeth, his mother fed him with soft-boiled rice, which she deftly tucked into his mouth with her fingers, and on which he thrived wonderfully. -->
<!-- When he fretted much, he was put into a pocket on the back of his eight-year-old sister, and she ran about or swayed to and fro to quiet him. -->
<!-- Indeed, he spent the greater part of first five years of his life on his mother's or his sister's back, sitting in a scarf tied over her shoulders, his arms around her neck, his legs dangling at her sides, and his head bobbing back, looking at the roof or the sky. -->
<!-- When he was three years old, the hair on his crown was allowed to grow long to be braided into a queue. -->
<!-- Almost as soon as he could walk and carry a basket and rake, he went with his next elder brother to gather fuel on the hills. -->
<!-- They scraped up the dry wild grass and the fallen needles of the pine-trees, and everything else they could gather to make the pot boil. -->
<!-- They had to supply all the fuel that was used for the family cooking, and rarely got beaten except when they failed to gather enough. -->
